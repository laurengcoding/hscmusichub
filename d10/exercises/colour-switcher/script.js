// When the grey button is clicked, the colour scheme of the page should change
// to more of a "dark mode" feel, with grey background and white text
// throughout. The white button should bring things back to the "light mode"
// colour scheme with white background and dark text.
//
// Do this by setting styles on the body element.
// Remember to try one step at a time, testing each stage as you go!
// TIP: There's a handy "shortcut" to get the body element without needing
// querySelector. Try logging `document.body` to the console (without the backticks)
// and see for yourself.

// When you're finished with the grey and white colour schemes, add a few more
// buttons and colour schemes. For each colour scheme you want to add you'll
// need a button element in the html, change the background in the css, and add
// the eventListener in the js.
