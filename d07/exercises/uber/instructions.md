## Here's what you should do:

- Remember what we just learned about responsive design: mobile first, how to construct a media query, etc.

- Include the images as inline SVGs on this project. Don't remotely load the SVGs like you would regular images, you lose one of their beneficial aspects that way. SVGs are scalable graphics that are super efficient because they are just code. **HINT: Open the .svg files in VSCode.** If you haven't seen SVGs yet take a little time to learn about them:

  - [SVG In HTML Introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/SVG_In_HTML_Introduction)
  - [Getting started with inline SVG](https://www.viget.com/articles/getting-started-with-inline-svg/)

- Match the mobile-first breakpoints Uber is using:

  - 545px for mobiles
  - 768px for tablets

- Think about how this layout will work. Draw it out if you have to. Remember you can do flex/grid inside of flex/grid, you'll need it for this layout.

- Also think about the flow of the content and why what they've done looks so good. All the content is the same size! Something to consider for your next project.

- Don't worry about matching the font - it's custom and $$$.

### Section 3:

```

Low-cost to luxury

Economy cars at everyday prices are always available. For special occasions, no occasion at all, or when you just need a bit more room, call a black car or SUV.
